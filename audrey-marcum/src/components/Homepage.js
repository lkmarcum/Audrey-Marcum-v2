      <h1>Hi, my name is Audrey and I have Bipolar Disorder.</h1>
      <p>
        My first manic episode led to a medical withdrawal after my first day of
        college classes. The last of my 6 hospitalizations was in 2009. Since
        then I graduated law school, made friends, passed the bar, got married,
        and am now in a fulfilling banking career. Living with bipolar disorder
        can be done. Thriving in spite of bipolar disorder can be done.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        Weâ€™ve all been fighting our own forest fires on our islands not knowing
        if there are any other islands doing well. This poorly edited story is
        for anyone who could use a success story and a roadmap forward for
        themselves or for a loved one.{' '}

        Feel free to download and share with anyone who you think may be able to
        benefit. 18-year-old me would have loved to hear a success story.
